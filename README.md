# HW9-Password-Generator

## Description

- Creating a fuctioning user-based, random password generator. This could be useful to an employee with access to sensitive data, so that their information may be protected. 

## Technologies Used:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. ScreentoGif

## Essential Code

![Generate Button](./Assets/GenerateBtn.jpg)

- The generate button code: (generateBtn.addEventListener("click", writePassword);). It takes the generate id from the HTML document and makes it available for JavaScript to use. The 'addEventListener' makes it so the code waits until the user 'clicks' on the generate button to initiate action.
